PastaCat provides instant popup websites for eCommerce and social media.

These are _complete_ sites, containing everything expected by an enterprise development team, not simple scafolding.

They also include scripts for testing, generating documentation and deploying.



With PastaCat you can create your own Facebook, Trip Advisor, Blog or Forum, 95% complete on day one. Functionality can be added quickly using the library of Angular components, and customized by editing Pug and Scss files. Back-end functionality can be added to the already-running Restful server.

Creating a website is often involves removing functionality, rather than creating functionality.

PastaCat also provides a wonderful training aid, with working examples .

#### About PASTAC

The PASTAC framework was initially created by the Development team of Tooltwist, and company that provides software development and consulting. With fifteen to twenty major projects in progress at any time, and after more than a hundred application developments over the past ten years, we found the common functionality required by many of our projects, developed micro services, and merged them with the latest development stacks.

The result is a framework that can be used for projects large and small, that gives us - and you - a massive head start on every project.

So why is it free? Well, most of our customers are enterprise customers, and we license them technology for use in-house, host the solution, provide premium functionality, develop cool applications, and in various other ways get paid. We don’t want to earn our income by writing the same code over and over for every project!

So, we host our parts of the the framework (Authservice, TEAservice and Crowdhound) for free, and maybe you’ll become an Enterprise customer of ours one day...
